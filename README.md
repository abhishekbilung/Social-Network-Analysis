# Social-Network-Analysis
This project focuses on Social Network Analysis (SNA) within a simulated social media platform called Threads. Although not a direct implementation of actual threads, this project uses code to create a structured data representation similar to threads, enabling the analysis of social interactions and relationships within a social network.
