# Social-Network-Analysis
This project focuses on Social Network Analysis (SNA) within a simulated social media platform called Threads. Although not a direct implementation of actual threads, this project uses code to create a structured data representation similar to threads, enabling the analysis of social interactions and relationships within a social network.
Key Features:

    Data Simulation: The platform generates user data, including posts, followers, and followings, creating a dynamic social network.
    User Interactions: It simulates typical user actions, such as following others, posting content, and interacting with followers.
    Network Metrics: The project applies various graph theory and network analysis metrics to assess the structure of the social network, including:
        Degree Centrality
        Closeness Centrality
        Betweenness Centrality
        Clustering Coefficients
        Graph Density and more.
    Graph Visualization: Tools for visualizing the network graph, allowing insights into the structure of the social media platform.
    Post Generation: Automatically creates simulated posts that users can interact with, just as on a real social network.

Objective:

The main objective of this project is to analyze how social media interactions (such as followers, posts, and likes) form complex networks and to explore how various network metrics can give us valuable insights into the relationships between users.

By simulating these interactions, the project provides an experimental setup to test and analyze network theory concepts and algorithms on a social media-like platform.
